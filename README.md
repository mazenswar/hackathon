## Design Statement:
An app to provide access to mental health services for young professionals (age 18-40) to whom access to mental health care was previously unavailable (due to financial reasons or lack of coverage).

## MVP:
- An app that facilitates the connection between a User (patient) and a Doctor who specializes in mental health services.
- The User logs in and is directed to a landing page which contains information about the app and a FAQ section. From a Nav bar, the User has the ability to access a list of doctors and the User's profile page. Within the Doctor's list page, the User can search for a doctor by name, filter by specialization/location/language/etc, and select a Doctor to view its page.
